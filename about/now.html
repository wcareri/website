        <h1>What I’m doing now</h1>

       <p>I’ve started to use social media less, and I typically reserve blog posts for completed projects, so consider this a <a href="https://nownownow.com/about" target="_blank">list</a> of works-in-progress for things outside of my day jobs.</p>
	   
	   <h2>Regular blogging</h2>

       <p>I rarely write for myself, which is something I wanted to correct in 2024. I tried blogging in college, but that was more career-driven and I wound up writing guides on logo design and public relations, which felt more like content marketing than blogging.</p>
	   
	   <h2>Data server efforts</h2>

       <p>I’ve taken steps to become more tech independent and archiving a lot of my personal data, distancing myself from services and companies offering storage solutions. I built a home NAS using a ZimaBlade 7700 and currently use it as a home base for media, projects, etc... cutting monthly costs by no longer subscribing to streaming services or paying for expanded cloud storage.</p>
	   
	   <h2>Learning Latin</h2>

       <p>I started learning Latin at the end of 2022. Originally, I was using Duolingo, but after a few months of being in a Latin learning community Discord server, I learned I was doing it all wrong. I now use the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1585104205/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title" target="_blank">Lingua Latina: Familia Romana workbook</a>, which has been invaluable. I’ve taken some time off to focus on other areas of interest, but I try and visit it every so often to stay fresh.</p>
	   
	   <p><i>Linguam Latinam discere coepi exeunte anno MMXXII. Primum Duolingo utebar, sed post paucos menses in Discord servo communitatis discendi Latinae, intellexi me omnia perperam facere. Nunc libro 'Lingua Latina: Familia Romana' utor, qui mihi perutilis fuit. Aliquantum temporis absumpsi ut alias studii res curarem, sed interdum eo redeo ut memoriam refricem.</i></p>
