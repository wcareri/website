        <h1>A New Look</h1>
		
		<p>I spent the better part of 2024 publishing articles on Substack, only to abandon the platform before entering 2025, completely redesigning my website around my new blog in the process. Here’s why.</p>
		<p>Back in May, I started publishing more personal writing on Substack. I never had a dedicated blog before and, as I stated in my inaugural article, “as someone who has written for most of their life, primarily as a hired (written) hand, my personal work has been scattered among cloud-based storage, random notebooks and loose-leaf scratch paper.”</p>
		<p>I was looking for a centralized place for my writing, and for some reason, I didn’t think of my website being that place. Don’t ask me why. What finally made me question this decision was <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/on-blogging-substacking-and-owning-digital-real-estate" target="_blank">an article</a> by Manu Moreale written just a few days ago. Based on what he had to say, in addition to others I’ve followed begin to abandon the platform, I followed suit.</p>
		<p>My old website was not built to house a blog. It was more-so for my portfolio pieces, which this site has, as well, but now the whole thing feels a bit more cohesive. This site is also easier to update. While I would love to build a site from scratch and host on a home server, today is not that day. My site remains built on Cargo, which works for me for now. I’ve migrated and backdated my writing from Substack here, so feel free to enjoy the archive.</p>
		<p>I’m looking forward to exploring blogging more as a writing outlet. Most of my writing has existed as professional writing and more free-flowing work has not been my bread and butter. Hopefully, this is the start of that.</p>
