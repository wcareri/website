		<p>Particularly during the end of the calendar year, we are bombarded with messages, emails, and social media posts from countless nonprofits and organizations seeking our help. While I can’t speak for them all, the ones here are ones I have looked into in-depth, or are personally involved with. If you are one of those people who would like to give but don’t know where to start, maybe this list can help.</p>
