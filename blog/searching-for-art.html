        <h1>Searching for Art</h1>
		
		<p>The past few years I’ve been collecting more things, particularly books and art—not for resale value or because of what they might be worth one day, but because I want to find keepsakes of people/artists I admire.</p>

       <p>I have a few signed prints by Jon Lomberg, the designer for the Voyager Golden Record and Carl Sagan’s artistic collaborator, which hang proudly in my office. I have signed books by my favorite authors like Lois Lowry and Mark Z. Danielewski, and a number of miscellaneous pieces as well.</p>
	   
	   <p>Recently I acquired original sketches and drawings by Mark Marek. Mark has directed episodes of Teen Titans Go, produced for Mad, and been an animator on dozens of kids shows; most notably for me—KaBlam.</p>
	   	   
	   <p>Mark created the Henry & June segments of KaBlam, which were some of my favorites because of the animation style, and I was able to speak with him and acquire more than 100 pages of original art, which are now in archival portfolios.</p>
