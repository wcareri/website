        <h1>The Broader Value of Higher Education</h1>
		
		<p>My parents had a pretty healthy attitude toward higher education. While they hoped my three sisters and I attended college, it was never a requirement. Whenever the conversation of careers came up, my father used to say we need to find something we love, and ideally it provides us with an income to sustain the lifestyle we wanted. If our goal was to live more minimalist or modest, then perhaps we didn’t need a six-figure income. But if we wanted a more luxurious lifestyle, we would have to be prepared to afford it. Given the fact that our blue-collar family grew up dollar-to-dollar and neither of my parents earned college degrees—though my mother did complete her associates in the latter half of adulthood—this may sound like privileged advice. Many parents I knew of families in similar situations pushed their children to “get out of this way of living and make as much money as possible.”</p>
		<p>Their philosophy led to diverse paths for my sisters and I—one without a college degree, one with a bachelors and now entering a trade school, myself with an advanced degree, and one with her doctorate.</p>
		<p>As a student, I observed a stark contrast between peers who pursued their studies driven by passion and those who selected majors strictly <a href="https://insights.som.yale.edu/insights/what-s-the-value-of-higher-education" target="_blank">based on potential income</a>. I began studying communications, a field often criticized for its lack of direct career paths compared to STEM fields. However, my education was not just about reading and analyzing texts; it was a deep dive into critical thinking and understanding diverse perspectives—skills that are increasingly valuable in today’s globalized and automated workforce.</p>
		<p>Historically, universities were meant to provide students with a well-rounded education, preparing them for life as educated and engaged citizens. <a href="https://online.utpb.edu/about-us/articles/humanities/the-value-of-humanities-in-education" target="_blank">The humanities were seen as a critical component</a> of this education, as they provided students with an understanding of history, culture, and language that would enable them to navigate and engage with the world around them.</p>
		<p>Throughout the past few decades, there has been a growing emphasis on vocational education and training in universities, driven in part by the perceived need to produce graduates who are prepared for the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2024/05/23/is-college-worth-it-2" target="_blank">demands of the modern economy</a>. This shift has led to a decrease in the value placed on the humanities, often seen as less directly applicable to the job market than more technical fields such as engineering, computer science, or even MedTech.</p>
		<p>As a result, humanities departments in universities have often <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/03/06/the-end-of-the-english-major" target="_blank">struggled with declining enrollment and funding</a>, leading to the perception that these fields are less important or relevant than other areas of study. This has been exacerbated by the increasing cost of higher education, which has made many students and their families more focused on the financial ROI of their education.</p>
		<p>From a historical perspective, this shift towards job-training and vocational education represents a departure from the original purpose of universities, which was to provide a broad-based education that would prepare students for a lifetime of learning and engagement with the world around them. While there is certainly value in vocational education, it should not come at the expense of the humanities, which are critical for fostering critical thinking, empathy, and cultural understanding.</p>
		<p>The emphasis on technical education and high-income careers is understandable, given the rising costs of college education and the economic pressures facing new graduates. Yet, this approach can be myopic. For instance, the tech industry, once the bastion of secure and lucrative jobs for anyone who could code, is now seeing a shift. With AI and machine learning evolving, the ability to interact with, manage, and innovate these technologies requires strong language skills and creative problem-solving—<a href="https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1447234.pdf" target="_blank">attributes strongly rooted in the humanities</a>.</p>
		<p>Yes, the freedom to choose a career based on personal fulfillment rather than financial necessity is a privilege not afforded to everyone. This reality is particularly poignant for younger generations, who are often burdened by student debt and face a housing market where the dream of homeownership seems increasingly out of reach, myself included. This economic pressure has prompted a significant shift in mindset. Many young adults are reevaluating what success means to them, often placing greater value on job satisfaction and quality of life rather than traditional markers of success like property ownership. This evolving perspective is reshaping career choices, pushing individuals to seek out roles that not only meet their financial needs but also align with their values and passions, even if those roles don't follow a conventional high-earning trajectory.</p>
		<p>As we continue to navigate this changing economic landscape, it's crucial to recognize that education should not just be a ladder to higher earnings but a platform to develop a well-rounded, fulfilling life. Encouraging young people to pursue their passions, whether in poetry or programming, does not mean compromising on financial security; it means equipping them with a diverse set of skills that are applicable across various industries and job markets. This more holistic approach to education may be the key to fostering not only more successful but also happier and more adaptable individuals in an unpredictable world.</p>
