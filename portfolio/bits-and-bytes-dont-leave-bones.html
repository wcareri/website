		<p>Migration is always more than just a transfer—it is a point of tension where preservation, power, and priorities intersect. Cultural artifacts, traditions, and knowledge do not simply move; they shift, adapt, and sometimes disappear in the process. Digital artifacts follow the same patterns. When MySpace <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/4/18295014/myspace-lost-songs-dragon-project-tracks-web-archive-internet-archive-450000-recovery" target="_blank">lost 50 million songs during a server migration</a>, it wasn’t just a glitch—it was a reshaping of independent music history, determined by infrastructure choices rather than cultural value. When NASA’s early satellite data became <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/19810004928/downloads/19810004928.pdf" target="_blank">inaccessible due to obsolete formats</a>, it was not just information that was lost, but a record of human exploration. Digital migration, like any form of migration, is not neutral. It dictates what is carried forward, what is altered, and what fades into obscurity—not through natural decay, but through deliberate and structural choices.</p>
		
		<h2>The Migration Imperative</h2>
		
		<p>Migration is a defining force of continuity and change. It is not just about movement—it is about survival. Whether shifting across geographies, languages, or systems, migration determines what knowledge endures and what is left behind. But survival is never guaranteed. Every act of migration introduces new vulnerabilities, reshapes meaning, and forces decisions about what is worth carrying forward.</p>
		<p>In the digital world, migration is relentless. Technologies evolve, platforms rise and fall, and systems that once seemed permanent become obsolete overnight. To remain accessible, information must continuously adapt—transferred, reformatted, or reconstructed in ways that often alter its original context. But migration is never neutral. The forces guiding these transitions—governments, corporations, institutions—determine what is preserved and what is discarded. Some histories are prioritized, while others fade into obscurity, not because they lack value, but because they were not deemed essential at the moment of transition.</p>
		<p>Loss is not always immediate. Sometimes, it happens gradually, as older formats become incompatible, websites disappear, or databases are decommissioned. Other times, it happens in an instant—a server failure, a policy shift, an algorithmic purge. Whether intentional or accidental, these disruptions create gaps in the historical record, shaping what future generations will have access to. The process of migration is both a safeguard against obsolescence and a mechanism of erasure.</p>
		
		<img src="../assets/images/portfolio/bits-bytes-dendrogram.png" alt="A circular dendrogram titled 'The Digital Decay Dendrogram,' categorizing digital artifacts based on their resilience to loss. The chart has three main sections: 'Most Resilient' (blue), 'Moderate Resilience' (yellow), and 'Most Fragile' (red). Each section branches out to include specific examples, such as open-source repositories, federated social media, and print archives in the resilient category, while cloud-stored files, social media posts, and streaming content fall under the fragile category. The design uses a dark background with colored branching lines to illustrate different levels of digital durability." style="width:100%; height:100%;">

		<h2>Digital Gatekeeping</h2>
		
		<p>Migration is never neutral. Borders dictate who is allowed to move and who is denied entry. The same applies to digital migration, where access to knowledge and cultural memory is controlled by gatekeepers—corporations, institutions, and platforms that decide what survives and what disappears.</p>
		<p>Like restrictive immigration policies, academic publishing limits movement: Elsevier and Springer <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/society/neuroimage-elsevier-editorial-board-journal-profit" target="_blank">charge exorbitant fees</a> for research access, creating knowledge borders that restrict participation. Open-access sites like <a href="https://annas-archive.org" target="_blank">Anna’s Archive</a> challenge these barriers, much like underground migration networks, offering access but risking legal suppression.</p>
		<p>Streaming services and media platforms wield similar control over cultural preservation. Media <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2024/08/david-zaslav-warner-bros-discovery-culture-deleting-movies-tv-shows.html" target="_blank">vanishes from streaming platforms like Max</a>, independent music disappears from Spotify, and digital newspaper archives are erased—not due to technical failure, but because of selective decision-making. The ability to preserve history is a form of power, and that power is rarely in the hands of the public.</p>
		<p>Even open-knowledge projects like the <a href="https://web.archive.org" target="_blank">Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine</a> face legal threats, echoing the way public records and historical narratives are censored. If we do not actively challenge who controls what survives, we will inherit a history defined by exclusion, erasure, and the priorities of those in control.</p>
		
		<h2>Migration as Loss</h2>
		
		<p>The process of migrating data—moving it from one system, format, or platform to another—has long been framed as an act of preservation. In theory, migration ensures that digital artifacts remain accessible as technology evolves. But migration is not a neutral act. Every time data is transferred, something is lost. Some losses are small and imperceptible, while others fundamentally reshape what survives.</p>
		<p>The most obvious casualties of migration are formats that become obsolete. Consider NASA’s early satellite data, which was stored on <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/19810004928/downloads/19810004928.pdf" target="_blank">magnetic tapes that are now unreadable</a> because the machines capable of playing them no longer exist. Or take the case of video games—thousands of titles from the 1980s and 1990s have become unplayable on their original hardware, requiring emulation or reconstruction by preservationists to remain accessible. Some publishers, like Nintendo, have begun re-releasing select legacy titles through subscription-based platforms such as Switch Online. But access to these games is no longer a given—what survives and in what form is dictated not just by technological constraints but by corporate licensing decisions, leaving vast portions of gaming history effectively locked away. Even when data itself remains intact, context can disappear. Websites from the early 2000s that have been archived by the Wayback Machine often appear as broken, disjointed pages, missing images, videos, or interactive elements. Without the full structure of the original, they become ghosts of themselves, fragmented and incomplete.</p>
		<p>This loss is not always accidental. Sometimes, migration is selective, with decisions made—either by individuals or institutions—about what is worth saving. Large-scale digitization projects, such as those undertaken by museums or archives, often prioritize materials based on perceived cultural or historical value. But what about the materials that don’t make the cut? A government agency digitizing census records might preserve official documents while disregarding handwritten notes. A publisher migrating its back catalog to digital might focus on bestsellers while letting lesser-known works fade into obscurity. The internet itself is shaped by these choices: search engines prioritize newer content, while older, less-trafficked pages are pushed further into irrelevance or purged entirely.</p>
		<p>A prime example of these challenges is outlined in the <a href="http://anthrodatadpa.org/Media/AnthroDataDPA%20Report.pdf" target="_blank">AnthroDataDPA Report</a>, a 2009 workshop summary funded by the National Science Foundation and the Wenner-Gren Foundation. The report underscores the precarious nature of anthropological data, detailing how fragile digital formats, inadequate archiving standards, and shifting institutional priorities have led to the permanent loss of valuable research materials. It calls for the development of standardized metadata, interoperable repositories, and sustainable digital preservation strategies to ensure that anthropological records remain accessible across generations. However, even with such efforts, the fundamental issue remains: not everything can be preserved, and choices about what is digitized and stored inevitably shape the historical record.</p>
		
		<img src="../assets/images/portfolio/bits-bytes-par.png" alt="A vertical timeline titled 'Preserving the Anthropological Record: A Timeline of Digital Preservation and Access (DPA) Efforts.' The timeline tracks major milestones in digital archiving for anthropology, starting from early preservation concerns in 1968 to recent developments in open-source archiving tools. Each section is color-coded, with blue for early concerns, orange for the emergence of digital archives, green for major initiatives, yellow for technological challenges, and pink for future steps. The design emphasizes the evolution of digital preservation efforts over time." style="width:100%; height:100%;">

		<p>Even as migration results in loss, it is also a necessary act of survival. Without migration, digital objects face an even greater threat: total disappearance. The preservation of early computer graphics, text files, and digital art often depends on individuals and organizations that actively convert these materials into newer formats before they become completely inaccessible. This is where digital archaeologists, amateur archivists, and fan-driven preservation efforts play a critical role. For example, when Adobe announced the end of Flash in 2020, a group of volunteers <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2020/11/19/flash-animations-live-forever-at-the-internet-archive" target="_blank">worked to archive thousands of Flash-based animations, games, and interactive projects</a>—pieces of internet history that would have otherwise been lost. Similarly, communities dedicated to old operating systems, defunct software, and even abandoned social media platforms continue to find ways to extract and maintain what others have discarded.</p>
		<p>But these efforts raise questions: How much of digital culture can we realistically preserve, and why do we choose to preserve some artifacts over others? What happens when we reach the limits of what is recoverable? And as new technologies emerge—artificial intelligence, decentralized platforms, immersive virtual spaces—how do we ensure that today’s digital artifacts do not become tomorrow’s inaccessible relics?</p>
		<p>Migration, then, is both a method of preservation and a mechanism of loss. With each transition, we carry forward what we can, but we inevitably leave something behind. And in a world where digital culture is constantly evolving, we must ask: Are we curating a lasting archive, or are we merely sifting through the wreckage of a disappearing past?</p>
		
		<h2>How We Can Preserve Digital Culture</h2>
		
		<p>If digital artifacts are so vulnerable to loss, how can we ensure they endure? Unlike physical objects, which can be carefully stored and conserved, digital materials require ongoing maintenance, redundancy, and active migration to remain accessible.</p>
		<p>One of the most effective preservation strategies is redundancy—storing digital artifacts across multiple locations and formats. The recommendation is the 3-2-1 rule—making three copies of your data, storing them on two different types of media, and keeping one copy off-site.</p>
		<p>Organizations like the Internet Archive and Anna’s Archive are working to preserve digital artifacts, though their missions are far from uncontested. The Internet Archive has curated everything from historical websites to handwritten <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2024/09/30/vanishing-culture-preserving-cookbooks" target="_blank">cookbooks from now-extinct communities</a>, preserving cultural knowledge in ways museums traditionally have not. Meanwhile, Anna’s Archive bypasses academic paywalls, making research freely available but raising legal and ethical questions about open access.</p>
		<p>Then there are individuals like Jason Scott, founder of <a href="https://textfiles.com" target="_blank">textfiles.com</a>, who has spent decades preserving early internet culture, ensuring that ASCII documents, hacker manifestos, and niche online discussions are not erased by technological progress. His work underscores a fundamental reality of digital preservation: without deliberate effort, history vanishes.</p>
		<p>Yet preservation without accessibility is meaningless. Open-source formats and decentralized archives help prevent knowledge from being locked away by corporations. Fan communities, too, play an essential role in saving lost media, though they often operate in a legal gray area.</p>
		<p>If digital culture is to endure, we must rethink ownership and stewardship—ensuring that the artifacts of today remain accessible for future generations.</p>
		
		<h2>A Call for Digital Stewardship</h2>
		
		<p>If digital shelves can vanish overnight, who is responsible for keeping them intact? The preservation of digital culture is not a passive act—it requires deliberate effort, continuous adaptation, and a recognition that what exists today may not be accessible tomorrow. Unlike physical artifacts, which can endure for centuries with minimal intervention, digital artifacts must be actively maintained, migrated, and protected. Without this stewardship, we risk allowing entire eras of knowledge, creativity, and history to disappear with the next technological shift.</p>
		<p>The challenges of digital preservation are not just technical but philosophical. Who decides what is worth saving? What happens when financial interests dictate access to cultural and academic materials? And how do we ensure that digital knowledge remains open rather than locked away behind corporate paywalls and proprietary systems? These questions remain unresolved, but what is clear is that the choices we make today will shape what future generations can access, study, and build upon.</p>
		<p>We have seen that preservation is not just the domain of institutions—it is also driven by independent archivists, fan communities, and open-access advocates. The Internet Archive, Anna’s Archive, and grassroots preservationists like Jason Scott are already doing this work, but they operate in a landscape filled with legal and financial uncertainty. If we want to build a more stable foundation for digital preservation, we must support efforts that prioritize access, redundancy, and open formats.</p>
		<p>Most importantly, we must move beyond the illusion that digital materials are inherently permanent. Data migration is not just a process of transferring files—it is an act of curation, one that determines what is carried forward and what is left behind. Whether we are scholars, archivists, artists, or everyday users, we all have a role to play in shaping the digital legacy that remains long after we are gone.</p>
		<p>So the question remains: What will we choose to preserve? And will future generations be able to access the knowledge we leave behind, or will they find only traces of what once was?</p>
