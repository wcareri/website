        <h1>Philadelphia City Council</h1>
	
		<p>From June – December 2021, I served as Councilwoman Cindy Bass' Communications Manager. I oversaw a wide variety of day-to-day responsibilities such as speech writing, event photography, social media management, media relations and content creation.</p>

		<p>At every event, I was responsible for photographing Councilwoman Bass and constituents. These photos were then sorted, edited and used for social media and marketing collateral.</p>
		<p>The Councilwoman used Twitter as her primary social media platform, followed by Instagram and Facebook. During my time managing the accounts, engagement reached an all-time high.</p>
		<p>Creating content was part of my day-to-day responsibilities and projects ranged from <a href="https://issuu.com/cindybassphilly/docs/october_2021_newsletter" target="_blank">quarterly newsletters</a>, marketing collateral, flyers, and more.</p>

		<p>I worked with media in a number of capacities, including pitching stories, organizing press conferences, facilitating interviews and generating background for reporters.</p> 
		<p>Overall, my time with Councilwoman Bass resulted in a 102% increase in organic social media mentions, monthly social media impressions reached an all-time high, with 41 secured media mentions in <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/news/philadelphia/philadelphia-pools-reopening-equity-hunting-park-20210630.html" target="_blank">local</a> & national publications.</p>
