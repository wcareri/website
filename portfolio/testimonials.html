		<p>“I had the privilege of having Will Careri’s assistance in both the formation of our organization, and in its actual operations. Briefly put, Will is peerless. He has a sensitive eye for design and presentation, and he listens perceptively and constructively. He engages as part of the team, conscientiously assisting us in carrying out our mission. Besides his professional skills, Will has demonstrated that he is a person of integrity and conscious. It is a rare bonus to have someone in a consulting capacity that feels...well, family. Will Careri is the recipient of both my trust and my highest endorsement.”</p>

		<p>“Will walked into a ‘cold start’ situation. We had no systematic social media program, and the website was only a few months old. Since the start of his work we’ve seen solid increases in engagement on all platforms and overall use of the site. Just as important, I’m impressed with Will’s timely and thoughtful communications. He does an excellent job keeping up with our work, even as he travels and/or attends to his other work.”</p>

Thanks to his dedication and creativity, we now have over 10,000 likes on Facebook and continue to grow. He’s always coming up with new ideas, videos and content to keep the fans engaged.”</p>

Through his leadership and strategic direction, we were able to boost participation in the midst of a global pandemic.”</p>
