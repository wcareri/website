        <h1>Um, Actually... TCG</h1>
	
		<p>Introducing the exciting new trading card game based on the hit show "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ft6N64pPll0" target="_blank">Um, Actually...</a>." In this game, players will compete to prove their knowledge of pop culture trivia and outwit their opponents by spotting and correcting "nerd culture" mistakes.</p>
		<p>Inspired by the popular <a href="https://dropout.tv" target="_blank">Dropout</a> series, the game features beautifully designed cards with intricate illustrations and clever references to all your favorite TV shows, movies, comics, and games.</p>
		<p>Whether you're a die-hard fan or just looking for a fun way to test your knowledge, "Um, Actually... the Trading Card Game" is sure to provide hours of entertainment and challenge.</p>
		<p>This project was completed as part of my curriculum at the <a href="https://mica.edu" target="_blank">Maryland Institute College of Art</a> while pursuing my master’s in data analytics and visualization.</p>
